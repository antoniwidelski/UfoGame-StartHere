# UFOGame

UFOGame is project that showcases my "Low Level" game programming skills like: OpenGL API, GLSL shader programming language, engine development(game loop etc.). It's 3d game engine on top of which I created game in where player's UFO captures frogs.

**Project contains:**
* Easy to create Scene.
* Object-oriented structre which allows easy creation of new game objects.
* Importing Models in OBJ format.
* Directional/Point/Spot Lights.
* Quick Gameplay

**Plans for future:**
* Shadows.
